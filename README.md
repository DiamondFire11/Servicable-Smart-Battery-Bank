# Servicable-Smart-Battery-Bank
This project aims to address the issue with most commercially available battery banks where once the cells in the battery degrade they are waste. The design of the battery bank utilizes replaceable Li-Ion 18650 cells. 

###This project is a work in progress
A microcontroller on each cell will be able to estimate the state of charge and state of health of each cell. It can also alert when there is a problem with the cell and remove it from the bank. A higher level microcontroller will balance the cells while attempting to maintain a steady voltage among all the cells.
